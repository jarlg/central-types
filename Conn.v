(* This is essentially the same as [conn_map_O_leq' (Tr@{j} n) (Tr@{i} n)], except that that needs [IsAccRSU (Tr n)], which I couldn't find in the library.  It follows from the results at the end of Spheres.v, but hasn't been filled in.  So we prove this directly.  (The other hypothesis of [conn_map_O_leq'] is found automatically.)  **  Results recently added to misc.v do show that (Tr n) is accessible, so this could be revamped. *)
